## The language of my Future

Right now I'm in my third year of computer science and I can say I really love it! So far I’ve been exposed to languages that include C, C++, C#, Java, and am now starting to learn JavaScript. Being a Junior I’m still exploring my specific career interests, but I’ve definitely narrowed my choices to Video Game Design or Backend Software Engineering. I’ve always loved video games and storytelling since I was a kid which is why going into a video game company would be a dream come true. The same goes with problem solving and design which is why Backend Software Engineering is also one of my top two career interests.

## C why I like it

My favorite language so far that I have experience in is definitely C, in my opinion, the syntax is a lot more user-friendly than Java and I prefer the print statements of C rather than those of C++ and Java. Even though I’ve just started learning JavaScript, I have a feeling that it will become my favorite language to code in just because of the fact that you don't have to cast your variables is so extremely user-friendly and makes coding that much more seamless. But, Java will always have a special place in my heart, it being the first language I ever coded in and died internally over.

## Be the change you want to see

I hope to develop my speed, efficiency, and confidence in my coding ability as I pursue my career. Specifically, I would really like to become an algorithm savant. Something about getting a problem and being able to not only solve it but to do it quickly and confidently know what data structure would be the most efficient. This is important to me because being a consumer, it really shakes me to my core when a game or website runs terribly when it's clearly an optimization problem. So I hope to one day be able to solve issues like that so people like me have a more seamless experience!

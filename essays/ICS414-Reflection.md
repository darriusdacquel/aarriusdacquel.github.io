### I. Reflection on the Semester

This semester was an incredibly challenging yet eye-opening experience. It began with excitement and optimism as we had an engaging project, and our group seemed motivated and eager to deliver something meaningful. However, the absence of a project manager proved to be a huge problem. Without anybody to hold us accountable and provide direction, many group members felt unmotivated or unsure of their responsibilities. This lack of structure created a cascade of challenges that tested not only our technical abilities but also our resilience and adaptability as a team.

### II. Key Challenges and Decisions

One of the most pivotal moments early in the project came when I noticed a significant lack of progress. Initially, we chose the Next.js framework, but it became clear that the steep learning curve and unfamiliarity with the technology were holding everyone back. To address this, I suggested switching back to Meteor and MongoDB, technologies that we used last semester, for our group. I created a poll in our Discord server, and all but one member (who remained unresponsive) agreed with the change. Although it was a difficult decision a month into the project, this shift was necessary to move forward.

Our struggles only deepened when group dynamics began to unravel. One team member dropped the course entirely after disappearing from day one. Another faced personal family issues that understandably limited their ability to contribute. One member simply never participated, leaving the remaining five of us out of an original team of eight to shoulder the project. This situation was demoralizing and overwhelming, but it also taught me a valuable lesson: when your team falters, you must step up and take ownership. I committed to doing just that.

### III. Taking on Leadership

Throughout the semester, I took on much of the project’s leadership and execution. I created around 90 percent of the project boards, issues, code reviews, and meetings. I delegated backend tasks to three group members while another dedicated team member and I focused on the frontend UI and integrations. Eventually, we found a functional, albeit imperfect, workflow. However, communication continued to falter. I repeatedly reached out, set up meetings, and encouraged my teammates to deliver, but participation dwindled as the semester progressed. During mandatory check-ins, promises were made but rarely kept. At a certain point, I realized I could not depend on others and decided to focus on what I could control by delivering my best work.

### IV. Sponsor Interaction and Technical Lessons

A turning point for me personally was a one-on-one meeting with our sponsor. This conversation was refreshing and insightful. He was kind, supportive, and clear in his expectations for the project. The meeting gave me a better understanding of the product vision and how we could align our work to meet the sponsor’s needs. One particularly difficult task involved reading complex CSV data files and integrating them into an online form. Despite our best efforts, we concluded that full implementation was not feasible due to the data’s complexity. From this experience, I learned an important lesson about working with stakeholders: sometimes sponsors may request something that is technically unachievable. In such cases, the best approach is to communicate honestly, manage expectations, and deliver a solution that comes as close as possible to their goals.

### V. Final Outcomes and Personal Growth

Despite the hurdles we faced, our group ultimately delivered a functional product. We successfully implemented role management, created a well-designed frontend, and integrated a CSV reading feature that, while imperfect, addressed key requirements. More importantly, I grew tremendously as both a developer and a team member. I learned how to navigate uncertainty, motivate myself in the absence of external accountability, and adapt to shifting circumstances.

### VI. Leadership Lessons

This semester reinforced that leadership is not about simply delegating tasks. It’s about stepping up when others cannot, maintaining focus on the end goal, and finding solutions in the face of obstacles. While the experience was far from smooth, I am proud of what we accomplished and the lessons I learned along the way. I now have a deeper understanding of teamwork, communication, and project delivery, which will undoubtedly serve me well in future endeavors.

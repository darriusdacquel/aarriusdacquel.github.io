## Discovering JavaScript

So far, I am a huge fan of JavaScript. It seems like Java but easier, which I really love. I have the most experience with Java despite the fact that it is my least favorite language to code in. An example of that is, funny enough, the print statement. System.out.print() is ridiculously tedious, and every other language I’ve used has nowhere near as annoying syntax as Java, with that print statement being a sneak peek of the syntax in Java.

## JavaScript vs. Other Languages

Compared to other languages I’ve used, which include C, C++, C#, and Java, this language, funny enough, seems like it's going to be my favorite. I’ve only had basic exposure to this language so far, but the fact that you don't have to cast your variables, in my opinion, is a huge game changer and it makes parameters and return types so much easier than the languages I’ve used so far. But other than that, it seems pretty standard and just an easier, more practical version of Java, which I look forward to!

## The Importance of Basics and Practice

The JavaScript exercises I went over did not exactly teach me anything new, but like any language, it's very important to learn basic specific syntax, and it ended up being very needed algorithms practice!

## Experience with Athletic Software Engineering

After participating in athletic software engineering for the first time, I surprisingly found it really fun and exciting. I'm not the fastest or most efficient coder, my biggest issue being able to remember syntax off the top of my head, but I usually always have a sense of what to do, which keeps me from panicking. I can see why I was warned about this at the same time. Anything time-based, especially coding, will cause almost any normal functioning human being to be at least a little stressed. With that being said, I see this being a powerful learning tool, and I can say confidently that this style of learning is not only challenging, but exciting and nerve-wracking in the best way possible. I hope to take advantage of this technique to further advance my coding abilities and job readiness.

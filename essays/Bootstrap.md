#This UI is going to make this easier, right?
Like any new language in the world of coding, it can seem like rocket science at first but as you practice and put time into that language, the fog surrounding the syntax begins to fade… maybe not as fast as we always want but eventually. The same goes for my experience with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 5. Learning HTML/CSS was surprisingly easier than I expected. For some reason my understanding of creating any sort of website was that it took years of expertise and the best equipment to get something like a picture to even show up. But funny enough it only takes like one line of code and ta-dah you have an extremely outdated but functioning web page with a single title. So after extensive practice with HTML/CSS I can comfortably make a website which is what I hoped to achieve eventually in my Computer Science career. But, as the dust settled I was thrown yet another framework which is always unsettling at first. As I mentioned in another one of my essays, my journey with Javascript was hard but extremely rewarding and remains my favorite language and then to be thrown a curveball, that being underscore freaked me out. But you begin to realize that these frameworks are made to make our lives as programmers easier and you start to wish you didn’t know about them because of how seamless and intuitive they are.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.

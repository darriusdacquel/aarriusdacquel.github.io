Like any new language in the world of coding, it can seem like rocket science at first but as you practice and put time into that language, the fog surrounding the syntax begins to fade… maybe not as fast as we always want but eventually. The same goes for my experience with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 5. Learning HTML/CSS was surprisingly easier than I expected. For some reason my understanding of creating any sort of website was that it took years of expertise and the best equipment to get something like a picture to even show up. But funny enough it only takes like one line of code and ta-dah you have an extremely outdated but functioning web page with a single title. So after extensive practice with HTML/CSS I can comfortably make a website which is what I hoped to achieve eventually in my Computer Science career. But, as the dust settled I was thrown yet another framework which is always unsettling at first. As I mentioned in another one of my essays, my journey with Javascript was hard but extremely rewarding and remains my favorite language and then to be thrown a curveball, that being underscore freaked me out. But you begin to realize that these frameworks are made to make our lives as programmers easier and you start to wish you didn’t know about them because of how seamless and intuitive they are.


##The Comfort of Familiarity

For many coders, our journey into web designs rightfully begins with a good foundation in HTML and CSS. This was my path as well which was founded from many hours of coding camp tutorials that were extremely satisfying and which almost felt like a video game as we got to see our website being developed simultaneously from the code we wrote directly to the right of our code. I kind of feel like I was tricked to enjoy learning HTML and CSS, this trick being the tutorial tasking me to create this cute penguin through over a hundred lines of code, which I willingly did for hours. Naturally, this gave me a deep sense of almost comfort and confidence in my ability to understand HTML and CSS code.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, my journey through the realms of HTML, CSS, and into the territories of Bootstrap 5 mirrors the evolution many developers experience: from skepticism to reliance. Bootstrap with its intuitive design and comprehensive documentation, not only made my websites look better but also deepened my understanding of the purpose of UI frameworks. It's a stark reminder to myself that the landscape of web development is ever-evolving, and staying open to new tools and frameworks not only enhances our skillset but also the quality of our creations especially as someone who feels unfulfilled the second I’m not able to learn something new and innovative. As I continue to explore the vast capabilities of Bootstrap, I once again have found respect for frameworks that make our lives as developers easier, more productive, and our websites more appealing to the world.
